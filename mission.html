  <p>Mankind has always been ambitious to exploring outer space , from the first man in space Russian astronout Yuri Gagarin 
    to the first man 
     to set foot on the surface of the moon American astronout Neil Armstrong . All this missions are a testament of the will of 
     humankind to explore space 
     and possibly colonize planets to become multiplanetary. Here are some of the most ambitious space programs man have ventured
      into and still planning for more ambitious programs 
 </p>  
 <div class="container">  
  <h2>Vostok 1</h2>
<p> At the height of the cold war between the soviets and Usa , the space race was on . The soviets seem to act hastily to send
   man to space . 
    Vostok 1 program launched the first man to space in 1961. The spacecraft completed a low arth orbit with a total flight
     time of 108 minutes . 
    Although fueled by cold war , this was a major achievment by man as it marked the start of the age of space exploration . 
    Yuri Gagarin upon return to surface 
    was awarded with the nations highest distinction . Hero of The Soviet union . </p>

  <h2>Project Apollo</h2>  
  <p>As a response to the soviets . American wanted a bigger and more ambitious progam , to land humans on the moon and to safely 
    return them on earh . 
    The apollo space program was responsible for this . In 1969 this mission was accomplished with astronouts Neil Armstrong and 
    Buzz Aldrn landing the 
    Apollo lunar module on the surface while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module . 
    Neil Armsrong become the first man to ever set foot 
    on the moon . All landed back safely in the pacific and subsequent apollo programs followed suit for other various missions </p>

<h2> The Voyager Spacecrafts </h2>
 <p>Launched in 1977 , this program is NASA's longest operating mission and only Spacecraft to explore interstellar space .
   The main goals for the program was to explore the outer planets .
   Both probe are currently in interstellar space (region beyond the heliosphere , suns protective bubble of particles and 
   magnetic field ) having made groundbreaking discoveries 
   .A 12-inch gold-platted copper disk is fitted  in the probes containing sounds and images to potray the diversiy of life
    and culture on earth , incase of encounters with extraterestrial life 
   . Among discoveries made are adittional moons on the outer planets and a detailed study of the outer planet atmospheres.
    While still operational the probes are running
   on dwindlimg power and some instruments have been shut off to extend their time  . The voyagers sure are attestation of  human ingenuity .

  <h2>The Hubble space telescope </h2>
  <p> Named in honor of  astronomer Edwin Hubble , the telescope is a space-based observatory that provides unprecedent 
    view of the universe in the wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum 
    from utraviolet , vivble and near infared . Launched in 1990 aboard the discovery space shuttle the telescope 
    is currently in orbit around the globe  at an altiude of around 515km . 
    Some of the most dtailed picture of nebulas and distant galaxies area result of hubble, significantly advancing our
     understanding of the universe including expansion of the universe , formation of galaxies 
    and nature of dark matter . Hubble telescope is nearing the end of its lifespan with its replacement already in orbit . the JWST

   <h2>Parker Solar Probe </h2>
    <p> On a mission to touch the sun , parker solar probe become the first spacecraft to fly in the sun's upper atmosphere 
      coming as a close as 6 millon kilometres of the suns surface 
        . On approach the probe reached speeds of 692,000 km/h making it the fastest ever man-made odject . it also provided
         insights on our closest star .That close to the sun 
        the probe relied heavily o the 4-inch carbon foam shileds to protect it from the extreme heat which can exceed 1 million
         degrees fahrenheit, hot enough to melt most metals 
        . The mission is still ongoing with aims to uncover more mysteries of the sun corona and solar winds . </p>

    <h2>ISS</h2>
   <p> The international space station is a collaborative orbitting research laboratory in low earth orbit , jointly operated 
    by five space agencies NASA
    ,JAXA,ESA,CSA and Roscosmos. It has been active since late 2000 bringing together international flight crews and multiple
    launch vehicles. It provides insight in training ,engineering and developmant in zero gravity  environmrnt.
    It orbits earth at an altitude of 400km circling the earth every 93 minutes averaging 15 orbits in a day . although the
     purpose of the ISS was to act as a  lab , observatory and factory while providing for transportation 
    , later it was given adittional roles such as  serving commercial, diplomatic and educational purposes . The ISS surely stands
     as a wonder of the modern word . </p>

    <h2>JWST</h2>
  <P>The best telescope that we currently  have is the James Webb space telescpe , the largest , most complex and most powerful . Unlike
     most telescopes that orbit's the planet in low orbit . The JWST is currently orbitting 
    at a point in space known as the lagrange point (l2) aproximately 1.5 million kilometres from earth . Mainly intended for 
    infared , the actual spectrum actually ranges from near-infared 
    ,mid-infared to limited visible . To make observatons in infared webb must be kept under -223° c otherwise infared radiation 
    from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments 
    . To achieve this the large sunshield block's light and heat from the sun ,earth and moon . its position on the lagrange point
     keeps all the three bodies on the same side at all times 
    .JWST isn't just a telescope , its a cosmic detective uncovering secrets older than dirt </P>

    <h2>Martian Moon Exploration (MMX)</h2>
  <p>The MMX led by japan is set to explore the two moons os Mars , Phobos and Demios with a planned launch in 2026 .
     the mission aim is to study formation and evolution of the two moons 
    and provide insights on how the processes shaped the martian system .The spacecraft will enter Mars orbit then to phobos 
    and land to gather samples 
    .It will then take off from phobos before making flybyes onto Demios and later send the return module back to earth , all 
    we can do is wait for the groundbreaking discoveries from the samples brought back .

  <h2>Europa Clipper</h2>
   <p>This is a space probe developed by NASA to study Europa , a moon of jupiter. Launched in october 14 2024 .the main
     aim is to explore Europa for habitability and aid in selection of a landing site for the proposed europa lander 
    .The spacecraft carries scientific instruments which will be used to analyze the potential presence of geothermal activity
     and the moon's induced magnetic field 
    . it used the gravity assist from Mars on march 1 2025 and will later use a gravity assist from Earth in december 2026 before
     arriving at Europa on april 2030
