<p class="intro-paragraph">Growing up we learnt that there were nine planets with pluto being exepmted in 2006 due to the planet being unable to clear its orbital path .
A planet is  a celestial body orbitting  a star ,and has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overome rigid bodies so that it assumes a hydrostatic 
 equilibrium shape , and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit .
Planets discovered out of our solar system are known as exoplanets . Approximately over 5500 exoplanets have been discovered to date and are still being discovered.
 Here are some of the most mind bending exoplanets ever discoverd .</p>

 <div class="planet-entry">
 <h2>Object J1407b</h2>
<p>Nicknamed "super saturn " or saturn on steriods , this planets boasts with the largest ring system ever discovered to date . The planet sits in the constellation 
Centaurus aproxmately 433 light years from earth . The ring system is aproximatedat 180 million kilometres wide . To put that into a rough perspective , if J1407b
was put in the position of our host star , the outer edges of the ring system would be between the orbit of earth and that of mars .
Surely saturn must feel like like a tiny, sparkly pebble before j1407b</p>

<h2> CFBDSIR J214947.2-040308.9 </h2>
<p>Meet object  CFBDSIR J214947.2-040308.9 or more casually known as cf 21, a very, very bizarre exoplanet disovered in 2012  by  Jonathan Gagn√©, Thierry Forveille,
    and Xavier delffose
     .A planet is a celesial body orbitting its host star ,
    exept that cf 21 isn't orbitting a star . its a free floating planet in the vastness of space commonly  known as a rougue 
    planet.There are quite a lot of free floating bodies in the vastness of space 
    but cf21 is just peculiar in its own way . To better understand the nature of this rogue planet 
we first have to turn to brown dwarfs . brown dwars are bodies with mass betwwen 13-80 that of jupiter . In short too
 big to be a palanet and too small to be a star . stars need about 80% 
the mass of jupiter for a thermonuclear fusion to power the star . For brown dwarfs the mass is not high enough so brown
 dwarfs fuse deuterium for a short period of time the cease altogether 
.This causes brown dwarfs to luminate heat and ligt in infared . The mass of cf21 is estimated to be 4-7 that of jupiter 
which means its not a brown dwarf . But wait , object cf21 
is luminating in infared . Newly formed planets luminate heat and light until they cool of which may take a few millon years .
 So its possible that cf21 is actually a newly formed planet . 
This led astronouts to make more observations to cf21 which revealed more bizarre nature of the exoplanet . Cf21 is in close
 proximity of AB Doradus , a young stellar moving group (a group of stars 
moving together suggesting a common origin ).if cf21 was part of ab doradus its high tempertures could be simply explained 
as a young planet ejected from its nursery . However observations seems to suggest 
otherwise . object cf21 is 130 light years from earth and ab darundus 75 light years from earth , a difference of 55 light
 years . a planet roamimg in space for that long has had time to cool off, should'nt luminate any heat and 
most of all its not that young . it's relatively old and have already cooled off . something is way off with object cf21 . could it 
possibly be a rougue planet , but the luminating heat seem to say otherwise , or could it be a planemo. 
Observations are still
 ongoing to find out the mystery behind cf21 , maybe its birthplace is not 
ab doradus or maybe something reheated the planet , only time will tell  </p>

 <div class="planet-entry">
<h2>Kepler-16b</h2>
<P>Now imagine on a bright sunny day , you look at the ground and see two shadows . This would be your situation if 
    you were standing 245 light years away
    on kepler-16b. Just that this wouldn't be possible as kepler-16b is a gas giant with a mass of around 0.333 that of jupiter 
    . kepler-16b orbits 
    two stars kepler-16A k-type main sequence star and kepler-16B  m-type red dwaf. The two stars orbit each other every 41 days 
    and kepler-16b orbiting both 
   .

<h2>PSR B1257+12 b</h2>
<p>Nicknamed after undead norse zombies,draugr, meet a dead world orbitting a dead star , a neutron star .To gain
     a better  understanding  lets turn to how stars die and a neutron star born 
    . What powers most star is the fusion of hdrogen into helium . At some point all hydrogen will be exhausted , when this happens the
     star starts to fuse 
    helium into more heavier elements like carbon and oxygen , but still at some point the helium also will run out . Depending on the 
    size of the 
    star , this process will continue with the star fusing more heavier elements until it reaches  iron . Unlike the elements before ,the fusion of
     iron is endothermic
    , it consumes energy instead of releasing . what happens when the core is not releasing energy to conter the gravity of such a massive star 
    .The core collapsess in itself trigerring a supernova explosion . For stars with solar masses betwwen 8-25, in the collapsed core
     protons and electrons merge 
    to form neutrinos hence the name neutron star . For anything larger than 25 solar masses the core collapses into a blackhole 
    .a newly formed neutron star can rotate upto a few 
    hundred times a second with magnetic poles emmiting beams of radiation. It becomes a pulsar . Well this planet is just what it's
      orbitting 
    .Located 2300 light years the planet orbit at 0.19 au from the pulsar . A planet that close would have been engulfed by the extemes
     of a supernova ,
    its possible that the planet was reborn afer the supernova to be at such a close proximity to the pulsar or could be that draugr was
     a tough guy and survived the unthinkable.
    What do you think ?
